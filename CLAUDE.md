# Tech CRM — Project Context

## What this is
Multi-tenant Lead Generation & CRM backend (Laravel), inspired by GoHighLevel.
Core loop: FB Ad → Landing Page/Form → Lead → Pipeline (Opportunity) →
Automated Nurture (SMS/Email) → Booking Calendar → Appointment →
Confirmation → Review Request.

## Stack
- Laravel (latest), MySQL, Redis (queues), Eloquent ORM
- Multi-tenancy: single DB, `location_id` column + global scope on every tenant table
- Twilio for SMS, [Mailgun/SES] for email
- Queues for delayed campaign steps, Events/Listeners for the Trigger engine

## Repo
GitHub: mohit-coded/tech-crm (private), main branch

## Conventions
- Follow standard Laravel conventions (PSR-12, Eloquent relationships over raw queries)
- Every tenant-scoped model must use the `BelongsToLocation` trait/global scope
- Migrations: one feature per PR, always include down()
- Write feature tests for controllers, unit tests for services

## Build order (Phase 1a complete: multi-tenancy foundation. Phase 1b in progress: auth wiring + multi-location membership.)
1. Auth + multi-tenant locations + Contacts/CRM base
2. Opportunities/Pipeline (Kanban)
3. Funnels/landing pages + lead capture
4. Scheduling/Calendar
5. Conversations (Twilio SMS)
6. Campaigns + Trigger engine
7. Reputation/review requests
8. Dashboard/reporting
9. FB Lead Ads + Google Business integrations

### Multi-location membership (Phase 1b)
- `location_user` pivot table (user_id, location_id, role) tracks which
  locations a user belongs to and their role there.
- `users.current_location_id` still represents the user's single
  *currently active* location — that's unchanged and is still what
  `BelongsToLocation`'s global scope keys off of.
- Access control over *which* locations a user is allowed to switch
  into is enforced separately, via the `location_user` pivot
  (`User::locations()` / `Location::users()`), not via
  `current_location_id`. `LocationSwitchController@switch` checks
  pivot membership (403 if none) before updating
  `current_location_id`.
